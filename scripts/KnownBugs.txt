-- Minor bugs --
- Interacting with something and then dying while the text window is open causes some weirdness
	- Overlapping dialog boxes don't really seem to break anything... but it's still a bug
- There is a bug(?), where if the player skips the text on the FRAME that it finishes typing...
	it seems to keep typing for an arbitrary amount of time.
	Not sure if this breaks anything, but could be something to fix
